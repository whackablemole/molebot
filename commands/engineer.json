	"tyre pressures": "Here are the ideal tyre pressures range.\nAll GT3 dry slicks: 27.4-28.0 psi\nAll GT3 wet tyres: 29.5-30.5 psi\n\nAll GT4 dry slicks: 26.5-27.5 psi\nAll GT4 wet tyres: 29.5-30.5 psi\n\nObviously depending on the situations and conditions you might find better handling and performance even if you go outside the proposed pressure ranges, but it is a good idea to stay in between initially.",
	
	"brake pads": "Brake pads and brake discs wear is relative to the brake pad choice, temperatures, driving style, ABS and brake bias usage. Brake disc and pad wear is shown at the end of each driving session, when you return to your strategy setup UI on the \"last readings\" box.\n\nAdditionally brake pads consumption will appear as a red dot in the center of the brake discs heat visualisation in the tyre and brakes HUD, when brake pads are under 10mm thickness.\n\n**Pad 1**: Very aggressive friction coefficient, max braking performance, aggressive disc and pad wear. Pedal modulation can be tricky if out of temperature or as it wears down. Use in hotlap and qualifying sessions, sprint races and can withstand 3 hours races. Risky and dangerous to use over 3 or 4 hours because the pads will wear down, overheat and lose linearity in brake pedal feel.\n\n**Pad 2**: Very Good friction coefficient, very good braking performance, good disc and pad wear. Pedal modulation almost always good and linear, good feedback while overheating and gradual wear. Perfect for endurance racing, but can also be used in hotlap , qualifying sessions as well as sprint races as what it loses in performance, regains in braking modulation and predictability. The default choice for long endurance races, easily makes 12 hours and can make 24 hours race too with a bit of care. Will also overheat and lose linearity in brake pedal feel when worn out, but in a more predictable way and after much longer stints. Because of the lower friction, you could possibly use smaller brake ducts.\n\n**Pad 3**: Moderate friction coefficient, braking zones can be longer in dry, very moderate disc and pad wear. Excellent pedal modulation also in cold ambient conditions, very linear pedal feedback. Excellent choice for wet conditions and very long endurance races. Very predictable and easy to modulate brake pad.\n\n**Pad 4**: Identical to pad1 but with exaggerated wear for fade demonstration purposes.",

But if your suspension is stiff, you might see that the lower you go the worse it gets. If that’s the case you need to raise fast bump to a much higher value(stiffer) and then fine tune again.\n\nThis happens because you need to control how much energy the spring absorbs from hitting a kerb (bump). All this energy needs to be released (rebound). If your damper is too soft, it will permit the spring to accumulate too much energy and you won’t be able to control it (jump).\nAlso… because dampers are magic.",
